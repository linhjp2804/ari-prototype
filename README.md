# Prototype and Report for ARI's Remarketing Program Portal 

My team and I delivered an interface solution for ARI Fleet Management via website prototype where we:
<li>	Developed a scope document to define the company’s current situation and challenge, identify potential risks, assumptions, constraints and suggest our solution.</li>
<li>	Led meetings to interviewed stakeholders to gather requirements regarding business rules, data and SMEs involved.</li>
<li>	Designed data schema, use cases, personas, and constructed a prototype using Justinmind to design an external portal that can help ARI manage the running and selling of vehicles for clients. (ARI’s remarketing program) </li>
